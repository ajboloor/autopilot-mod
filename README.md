# Autopilot Mod for Factorio v0.16.36+

### Version
0.1.0, compatible with Factorio v0.16.36

### Description
- The intention is to take automation in [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) to another level by enabling automation of the player itself.
- The mod creates a new craftable item called 'Autopilot Armor'. When equipped it scans the surface for the nearest 'iron-ore' (currently this can be changed by changing the 'entity' value in the mod file itself) and walks to it. 
- The current version does not include collision detection.
